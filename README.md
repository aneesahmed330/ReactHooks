# ReactHooks

Here in this Repository , I add code for learning React Hooks

## Hooks I Looked so Far

- useState ( above setting state in SFC )
- useReducer ( Changing or Performing action on Single Handler )
- useEffect ( Relate to many LCH in FC i.e ComponentDidMount, ComponentDidUpdate , ComponentUnMount )
- useRef (specific targeting HTML elements )
- useImperativeHandle ( Can be use to perform action from another components )
